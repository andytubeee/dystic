**Note**

If you receive an error while searching for jobs, that generally means there is a captcha blocking the request. As a workaround go to Indeed's website and finish the captcha challenge. Currently, our job search only supports areas within the US.

## Future Plans

* We hope to support an international search so users outside the US are able to use it

* Find a workaround for the Indeed captcha

* Implement ML to return jobs suitable for any user rather than using only keywords

* and more!
